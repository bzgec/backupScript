= Backup script

== Info
This is python script used to backup folders to external hard drive.
It uses link:./rsync.md[rsync] command to check if files/folders need to be copied before the
actual copying.

[NOTE]
====
`rsync` command can also delete files!!!

You must set "no-delete" option in configuration file if you don't want to
delete files on backup disk/folder.
====

For now only Linux systems are supported (don't know how it is on Windows and
link:./rsync.md[rsync] command).

WARNING: We are not responsible for any data loss.

=== Intentions
* replace manual copying of important/special files
* make copying more efficient (copy only those files which have changed).

link:./rsync.md[Here] you can check from some information about `rsync` command.

Note that before actual copying/backup a *dry run* command is run which shows what a real command
is going to do.
The default link:./rsync.md[rsync] command: `rsync -rltgoDvP --modify-window=1 --delete`.


== Usage
* You must specify which folders/disks to backup. This information is stored in a
configuration file.

** Configuration file:
*** link:./exampleBackupConfig.py[example]
*** link:#configuration-file[detailed description]

** How to pass configuration file to the script:
*** create `backupConfig.py` file in the same directory as link:./backup.py[backup.py] script
this way you don't need to specify configuration file when you launch the script,
so script can be launched like this: `python backup.py`
*** pass configuration file as an argument when you launch the script:
**** `python backup.py -c myBackupConfig.py`
**** `python backup.py -c myBackupConfig`

* The script first runs a *dry run* which shows what a real command is going to do. This is used
because that way we can cancel if we see that something would go wrong. So first a *dry run*
command is run and than you get prompted if a real command should be run.

* Run `python backup.py -h` to see all the available options for configuration of this script.


== Configuration file [[configuration-file,Configuration file]]
* link:./exampleBackupConfig.py[Example]

=== Special "folders" options:
* `exclude`: specify which files/folders/patterns to *not* include in the backup
* `options`: specify special options for `rsync` command
** `no-delete`: keep files/folders which don't exist on source path but exist on destination path
(this is useful for folders like Pictures...)
